There once was a lil’ coder named Pip,  
He’d ping each API like a friendly trip.  
With a curl in his pocket, a swagger in his stride,  
He’d check every endpoint and test the API’s hide.  

“Let’s throw a payload, let’s throw a GET,  
If the server says 200, that’s the win we’ll set!”  

When the bugs were gone, he’d grab his hat,  
Push a new tag, create a GitHub *release* that’d chat.  
“Yo, check out the version!” he’d cheer with glee,  
And the repo would glow—oh, how wild it’s free!  

So if you’re ever stuck in a code‑loop haze,  
Just call little Pip and he’ll sprint your way.  
He’ll send your APIs, make your release sing—  
A little coding hero with a keyboard in wing! 

Git on now, Git!
